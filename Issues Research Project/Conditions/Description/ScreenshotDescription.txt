  SCREENSHOTS DESCRIPTION

  If any test, part of this Visual Studio Selenium UI Automation's project, fails, the web driver has to take a screenshot to the browser. 
The only important condition is the names of the screenshots to be the same ones as the names of the failed tests. These screenshots have
to be located on a project's specially created "Screenshots" folder.
