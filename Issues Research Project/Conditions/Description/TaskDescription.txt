  AUTOMATION TASK DESCRIPTION

  The basic idea for creating this GitHub repository is to be used the GitHub "Issues" option for adding some test cases and issue reports
manually, but there is a possibility for automating these test cases with the help of Selenium WebDriver in Visual Studio. In spite of the
fact that there are video recording added to every issue report, presenting the reason of failing of its related test case, the automation
of all already designed test cases gives a new option for browser's screenshots with the names of the failed tests. So, the "UI Automation
with Selenium WebDriver, using Visual Studio as IDE" option is useful as alternative of the manual tasks' execution and gives more benefit 
for the project as a whole.
