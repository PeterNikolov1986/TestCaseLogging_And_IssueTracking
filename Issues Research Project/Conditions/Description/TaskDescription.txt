  TASK DESCRIPTION

  The basic idea for creating this GitHub repository is to be used the GitHub "Issues" option for adding some test cases and issue reports
manually, but there is a possibility for automating these test cases with the help of Selenium WebDriver in Visual Studio. In spite of the
fact that there are video recording added to every issue report, presenting the reason of failing of its related test case, the automation
of the manually created test cases gives a new option for browser's screenshots with the names of the failed tests. So, the "UI Automation
with Selenium WebDriver, using Visual Studio as IDE" option is useful as alternative of the manual tasks' execution and gives more benefit 
for the project.

 • the names of the manually created test cases are shortened in the Visual Studio Selenium UI Automation's project - the articles, chosen
   to be objects for testing, and most of their "Quick Navigation" section's hyperlinks, which successful opening has to be verified, have
   too long names, so the following principle is used for shortening of the test methods' names:
          - the articles, chosen to be objects for testing, are known as "First Article" and "Second Article";
	  - every "Quick Navigation" section's hyperlinks is named after its order in the "Quick Navigation" section and its article - for
   example, the "What is Zafira?" hyperlink is the first "Quick Navigation" section's hyperlink of the second article, and so on.
