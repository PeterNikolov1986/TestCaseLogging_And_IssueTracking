  AUTOMATION TASK OBJECTIVES:

• to be shortened all designed test cases' names in the Visual Studio Selenium UI Automation's project:

  - the original names of the already designed test cases, logged in the current GitHub repository through its "Issues" option, are longer 
    than their expected length, so:

    - the first "Automate the planet" website's article, chosen to be object for testing - "Jenkins C# API Library for Triggering Builds" -
      has to be shortened as "First Article" in the Visual Studio's project;

    - the second "Automate the planet" website's article, chosen to be object for testing - "Test Automation Reporting with Zafira in .NET 
      Projects" - has to be shortened as "Second Article" in the Visual Studio's project;


• every article's "Quick Navigation" section's hyperlinks - which successful opening has to be verified - are found as web elements, part of 
a list in the Visual Studio's project, so:

  - the original names of all "Quick Navigation" section's hyperlinks are shortened in the Visual Studio's project in accordance with their
    order in the list and with the article, part of which "Quick Navigation" section they are.

    - for example, the "What is Zafira?" navigation hyperlink, part of the "Quick Navigation" section of the "Test Automation Reporting with 
      Zafira in .NET Projects" article, has to be shortened as the "first "Quick Navigation" section's hyperlink of the second article".


• to be invented a principle for implementing of all manually designed test cases as test methods in the Visual Studio's test project:

  - this principle has to depend on the test cases' original names and on their expected result for getting maximal benefits from the current
    UI Automation test project.

    - in accordance with the latter example and with the test case's expected result, the test case, named "Open "What is Zafira?" hyperlink"
      will be implemented as the "SecondArticle_FirstQuickNavigationHyperlink_ScrollsThePageTo_ItsProperSection()"  test method in the Visual 
      Studio's test project.


• the principle for implementing of manually designed test cases as test methods in the Visual Studio's test project, described above, will be
used in a similar way for all test cases, logged in this GitHub repository through its "Issues" option!
